# Next Agent Guide - MegaTunix Redux

## üöÄ **Latest Update: Critical Bug Resolved!**

**CRITICAL ISSUE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED**: The ignition table keyboard navigation bug has been completely resolved! The root cause was hardcoded VE table references in the arrow key navigation code, causing data corruption when navigating in the ignition table.

### **What Was Fixed**
- **Keyboard Navigation Bug**: Arrow keys were using `g_ve_table->width` instead of `active_table->width`
- **Data Source Mismatch**: This caused wrong table dimensions and data corruption
- **Inconsistent Values**: Different values appeared when using arrow keys vs. double-clicking

### **Current Status**
The ignition table now provides a **smooth, professional editing experience** that matches TunerStudio's behavior exactly. All major issues reported by users have been resolved.
