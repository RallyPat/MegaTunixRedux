# MegaTunix Redux - Source Code

**Original MegaTunix designed and written by David J. Andruczyk**  
**Redux version by Pat Burke (2025)**

This directory contains the source code for MegaTunix Redux, a complete ground-up rewrite 
using modern technologies including SDL2/Clay UI for rendering and cross-platform compatibility.

## Architecture Overview

The Redux version maintains the plugin-based architecture of the original but with significant 
modernization:

- **Modern UI**: Clay immediate-mode UI framework with SDL2 rendering
- **Cross-platform**: Native Linux, Windows, and macOS support  
- **Real-time Performance**: Hardware-accelerated rendering and optimized data streams
- **Plugin System**: Extensible ECU protocol support (see plugins/ subdirectory)

## System Requirements

**Dependencies:**
- SDL2 and SDL2_ttf (cross-platform graphics and text)
- CMake 3.10+ (build system)
- C11 compatible compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC)

**Platform-specific packages:**

**Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):**
```bash
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev pkg-config
```

**macOS (Homebrew):**
```bash
brew install cmake sdl2 sdl2_ttf pkg-config
```

**Windows (MSYS2/MinGW):**
```bash
pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-cmake mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2 mingw-w64-x86_64-SDL2_ttf
```

## Building

See the main project README.md for complete build instructions.

## Plugin Development

The plugins/ directory contains ECU communication modules. See plugins/README for 
information on developing new ECU protocol support.
